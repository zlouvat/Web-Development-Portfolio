## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style web applications using pre-defined classes. It provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to create custom designs.
Key features:

- Utility-first approach: Instead of pre-designed components, Tailwind provides utility classes for styling individual elements.
- Highly customizable: You can configure and extend the framework to fit your design needs.
- Responsive design: Built-in support for responsive design using breakpoints.

  With Tailwind CSS, you can write concise and maintainable CSS code by applying utility classes directly to your HTML elements. This approach enables rapid development and flexibility in designing your web application's layout and visual styling.

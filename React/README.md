React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Vite is a development tool that provides a fast and efficient way to build and serve web applications.
React:

- A library for building reusable UI components
- Ideal for creating complex, data-driven user interfaces
- Uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance

  Vite:

- A development server and build tool

- Supports modern web development features like ES modules and CSS modules

Together, React + Vite offer a powerful combination for building fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Vite's speed and efficiency complement React's component-based architecture, making it a popular choice for modern web development.

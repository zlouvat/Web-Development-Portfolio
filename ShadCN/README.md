    This Assignment makes use of tailwindcss along with ShadCN to create stylized components with the Shale color scheme in ShadCN. I personally messed around with the way the left navigational bar worked, also known as a dropdown menu, and changed a few of the icons along with adding the Binary section. That makes use of the lucide-React library to create those small icons we see to the left.

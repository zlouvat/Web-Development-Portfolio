## Figma

Figma is a phenomenal tool to help assist people in the creation of websites through creative design without any coding knowledge required. You can apply different website styling simply in a Photoshop manner through images and components to create a basic framework that can be applied easily through a coding process. One great feature of figma, with great help from AI, is that you can take a figma and hand it off to Cursor, AI coding environment, to easily implement it's interpretation of the project you gave it.
